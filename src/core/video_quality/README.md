## VideoQuality Module Documentation

**Purpose**

The `VideoQuality` module is designed to assess the quality of a video recording based on two key metrics: sharpness and brightness. This information can be valuable in interview settings to ensure optimal video quality for effective communication.

**Code Explanation**

**Classes**

* **VideoQuality:**
    * **`__init__(self)`**
        * Initializes the class and creates a logger instance using the class name.
    * **`_calculate_sharpness(self, image)`** (Function)
        * **Input:** A numpy array representing an image.
        * **Output:** A float value representing the image's sharpness calculated using the Laplacian variance method.
        * **Purpose:** Calculates the image's sharpness by measuring the Laplacian variance, which indicates high-frequency content associated with edges and details.
    * **`_calculate_brightness(self, image)`** (Function)
        * **Input:** A numpy array representing an image.
        * **Output:** A float value between 0 and 1 representing the image's average brightness.
        * **Purpose:** Calculates the image's average brightness by taking the mean pixel value and normalizing it to a range between 0 and 1. 
    * **`_classify_metric(self, value, thresholds)`** (Function)
        * **Input:**
            * A float value representing the metric (sharpness or brightness) to be classified.
            * A list containing two thresholds used for classification.
        * **Output:** A string representing the classification ("Poor", "Good", or "High") based on the metric value and thresholds.
        * **Purpose:** Classifies the metric value into categories based on predefined thresholds.
    * **`_process_image(self, image)`** (Function)
        * **Input:** A numpy array representing an image.
        * **Output:** A tuple containing two float values - sharpness and brightness of the image.
        * **Purpose:** Calculates the sharpness and brightness of the input image using the respective functions and logs the values using the class logger.
    * **`calculate(self, image_arr)`** (Function)
        * **Input:** A numpy array containing multiple images (frames).
        * **Output:** A dictionary containing various statistics about the video quality, including average sharpness, sharpness classification, average brightness, brightness classification, and overall quality classification.
        * **Purpose:** The core function that processes each image in the provided array, calculates sharpness and brightness, classifies them, and returns an overall video quality assessment.

**Functions**

* **`run()`** (Function with `@time_execution` decorator)
    * **Purpose:** This function serves as the main entry point for the module. It defines the directory containing video frames (modify the path as needed), processes each frame using the `VideoQuality` class, and prints the video quality statistics returned by the `calculate` function. 

**Additional Notes**

* The code utilizes the OpenCV library (cv2) for image processing tasks.
* The `singleton` decorator ensures that only one instance of the `VideoQuality` class is created.
* The `convert_to_grayscale` function (imported from `src.utils.utils`) likely converts the images to grayscale before processing, potentially simplifying the sharpness calculation.
* The `logging` module is used to record information about the sharpness and brightness values for each image.

This documentation provides a high-level overview of the `VideoQuality` module and its functionalities. Refer to the actual code for detailed implementation specifics.
